# Codes for Physical Audio Phenomena in Unreal Engine

This folder contains various programming codes that I created to explore the physical phenomena of audio in **Unreal Engine** using **C++**.

## Content:
- Playing Sounds: Examples of how to play sounds using SoundCue and AudioComponent.
- **Changing Audio Parameters**: How to adjust parameters such as volume, pitch, and more.
- **Environmental Sound Effects**: Implementation of sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.

Feel free to explore and use these codes for your portfolio or personal projects!

Kind regards
Michele Grimaldi
